Sparta Science can predict injuries before they happen. We identify athletesâ€™ injury risks and recommend customized training plans to reduce the chance of injury. Our customers are professional and university sports programs (including NBA, NFL, MLB, and NCAA teams), hospitals, and the US military. Our web application is built on Elixir/Phoenix, and our scanning process relies heavily on Phoenix Channels.
