The days of top-down sales management are over! We are bringing Agile to Sales, empowering salespeople to improve performance with better data and collaboration. We believe that CRM software built as a “system of record” adds little value to salespeople. Heresy is a workflow application, that enables sales professionals to manage their workload, forecast accurately and crush targets every month. Through its usage, we are able to aggregate valuable data that provides salespeople and their managers with unique insights without having to run a single report. Main product and platform are built exclusively using Elixir and Phoenix.
